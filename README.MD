#New Crawler


##Purpose

This project is a practice of web crawler implementation. I implement a crawler to extract news from the school webpage. I record the updating frequency of every school news page and their last update time. Under the assumption that the updating time has distribution Poisson distribution, the crawling frequency is appropriate to be 5 times in proportion to their update frequency.
